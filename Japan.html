If records are to be believed, most of the railways operate at more than 100 per cent overcapacity. To tackle this situation, the city even hires ‘transit pushers’ to push people inside the trains during rush hour.*Slurping noodles in Japan is considered polite, as according to them, it displays appreciation for the food. So, the next time you go to a noodle restaurant in Japan, slurp and enjoy your noodles to the fullest.</p>
