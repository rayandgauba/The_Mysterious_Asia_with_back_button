        <p>*Chinese army has the biggest number of soldiers in the world (more than 2 million people).Just to compare — it’s the same as the population of Paris.*China is the owner of all pandas. Literally, all of them! Every single panda that lives on this world belongs to China.If you see a panda in other countries, it means it is lent from PRC (People’s Republic of China). What’s interesting is that when a baby panda is born, it is sent to China (always by FedEx) to help expand the gene pool.*China is the most populated country in the world. No wonder they have huge traffic jam problems.What to do when you are late on your meeting and you are stuck in a traffic jam? You are calling the bottleneck rescuers! Two guys will come to you on a motorbike. One will drive you whenever you want and the other will take your place in a car.Clever, huh?*Who doesn’t love ice creams? We can eat this delicious dessert thanks to China. It is believed that they first made it more than 4000 years ago by mixing milk and rice mixture with the snow.*Nowadays, we all know that the blood is circulating in our veins. But it wasn’t so obvious in the past.European scientist William Harvey was proud to announce this in 1628. He didn’t know that Chinese people discovered it… more than 2000 years before him!</p>
